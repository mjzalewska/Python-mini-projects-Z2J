THE_CROSSROADS_START

You've been walking for days on. You come to a crossroads.
It's getting dark. A forest is looming in the distance.
There's an inn close by, but you desperately want to get THERE.
What do you want to do?
[1] Stay at the inn
[2] Move on. You can do it

THE_INN_START

You fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow.
It seems you were more tired than you'd realized! Good call!
#

You wake up at dawn, and you instantly spot a glimmering object lying on the table by the window.
What do you do?
[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

[an old key]

Let's move on then!

THE_INN_END


THE_SLEEPING_FOREST_AFTER_INN_START

You walk into the forest. It's unnaturally still and dark.
Not even the slightest sound or faintest ray of light...
As you make your way through the undergrowth you notice something shining bright blue a short distance away.

[1] Leave it
[2] Check it out

#1 You've decided to check what it is. Looks like it's just a small blueish pond.
But wait. What are those fish-like creatures?! You've been surrounded by Fishermen.

[1] Fight
[2] Run

Won: The Fishermen ran away. One of them dropped a bright blue stone.
What do you want to do with it?

[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

[water stone]

Lost:
You've lost. Game over!

#2 You ignored it. The sooner you get to the end, the better. Let's go!

THE FIELDS_AFTER_INN_START

You decided to take the right turn on the crossroads.
You've been walking across vast fields for hours now.
It's getting darker and darker, and you hear some strange noises.
A Wolfpack! Too many of them!
You can't run. Fight!

Won: You scared them off! They dropped something when running away.

[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

[a fire stone]

It's getting darker by the minute.
You decide to walk a little further, and come up against a solid wall of rock.
A dead end! You'll have to camp here for the night, and return to the crossroads tomorrow.
You can use the fire stone to make a fire to fend off wild animals.
What do you want to do?

[1] Use the stone
[2] Sleep in the cold

Lost:
You've lost. Game over!

THE_FORLORN_VILLAGE_START

You walk through an old, crumbling gate and take a look around.
Seems like it's been a long time since anyone lived here.
Better find somewhere to stay for the night.
You can see a couple of small dilapidated houses.
What do you want to do?

[1] Search them. Maybe you can find something useful there.
[2] Leave them. You will camp outside tonight. You never know what dangers might be lurking in the shadows.

## First_building
You approach the first building. It looks like an old smithy.
It's dark inside.

** if use matches **
You light a match and take a look around.
No food or drink. But you find something that looks like a weapon.
[a titanium sword]

[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

Ouch! You've burnt your fingers!
Better leave now.

** if not try to use matches **
Too dark. Can't see a thing.


## Second_building
Judging by the board hanging loosely over the entrance this must've been a shop.

** if use matches **
You light a match and take a look around.
You spot
[a can of sardines]
[a pack of sugar]

lying in a corner.

[1] Take them
[2] Leave them

** if not use matches **
Too dark. Can't see a thing.

## Third_building

** if use matches **
Looks like an old guesthouse.
You light a match and take a look around. Oh, and old candle!
You light the candle and carefully examine every nook and cranny.
Looks like a safe place to stay. What do you want to do?

[1] Stay for the night
[2] Leave


** if not use matches **
Too dark. Can't see a thing.

## sleep (10)

You wake up at the break of dawn.

** if slept outside **
It rained heavily over the night. All your things got wet!
You caught a cold and lost 50 HP

** if slept inside **
Wow! You slept surprisingly well on that old straw mattress.
You gained 100 HP.

Time to move on!

THE_ANCIENT_TEMPLE_START

You leave the village and find yourself on the side of a vast lake.
In the middle of the lake sits an old temple.
It's two towers seems to touch the sky.
