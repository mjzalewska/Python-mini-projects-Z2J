THE_CROSSROADS_START

You've been walking for days on. You come to a crossroads.
It's getting dark. A forest is looming over the horizon.
There's an inn close by, but you desperately want to get THERE.
What do you want to do?

[1] Stay at the inn, and get some good night's sleep.
[2] Move on. You can do it!

THE_INN_START

You fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow.
It seems you were more tired than you'd realized! Good call!

You wake up at dawn, and you instantly spot a glimmering object lying on the table by the window.
What do you do?
[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

[an old key]

Oh! A box of matches. Might come in handy later on.
What do you do?
[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

Let's move on then!

THE_INN_END


THE_SLEEPING_FOREST_AFTER_INN_START

You walk into the forest. It's unnaturally still and dark.
Not even the slightest sound or faintest ray of light...
As you make your way through the undergrowth you notice something shining bright blue a short distance away.

[1] Leave it
[2] Check it out

#1 You've decided to check what it is. Looks like it's just a small blueish pond.
But wait. What are those fish-like creatures?! You've been surrounded by Fishermen.

[1] Fight
[2] Run

Won: The Fishermen ran away. One of them dropped a bright blue stone.
What do you want to do with it?

[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

[water stone]

You're exhausted after the fight, but you decide to move on.
Who knows what other creatures might be lurking in the dark.
...
After what seemed like days, you see sun rays shyly shining through the thick, dark branches.
You made it!
As you walk out of the forest you see a village looming on the horizon.
The sun is setting. Better hurry up. Maybe you can get some rest there.

Lost:
You've lost. Game over!

#2 You ignored it. The sooner you get to the end, the better. Let's go!

THE FIELDS_AFTER_INN_START

You decided to take the right turn on the crossroads.
You've been walking across vast fields for hours now.
It's getting darker and darker, and you hear some strange noises.
A Wolfpack! Too many of them! You can't run. Fight!

Won: You scared them off! They dropped something when running away.

[1] Take it
[2] Leave it

[a fire stone]

It's getting darker by the minute.
You decide to walk a little further, and come up against a solid wall of rock.
A dead end! You'll have to camp here for the night, and return to the crossroads tomorrow.

You can use the fire stone to light a fire - it will keep you warm and keep away wild animals.
What do you want to do?

[1] Use the stone
[2] Sleep in the cold - the stone might come in handy later.

Lost:
You've lost. Game over!
